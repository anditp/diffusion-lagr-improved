# diffusion-lagr-improved

This is the codebase of Generative Diffusion Models Commence a New Era in Synthetic Turbulence.

This repository is based on [SmartTURB/diffusion-lagr](https://github.com/SmartTURB/diffusion-lagr), with modifications specifically tailored to adapt to the Richardson pair dispersion dataset based on the Lagrangian turbulence data in Smart-TURB portal http://smart-turb.roma2.infn.it, under the TURB-Lagr dataset.

For further details on usage please see [SmartTURB/diffusion-lagr](https://github.com/SmartTURB/diffusion-lagr) and the hyperparameters used in Generative Diffusion Models Commence a New Era in Synthetic Turbulence.
